## Fabric-Forge Project Template
This repository is a template for setting up a multi-project using [Architectury](https://docs.architectury.dev/start). Duplicate this project and go 
through the files `architectury.common.json`, `fabric.mod.json`, `mods.toml` as well as all the **package names** and 
`.mixins.json` files and change all occurrences of the word `template` to your mod-id. In addition, change instances of 
my name `invictusslayer` to your own. After doing so change `gradle.properties`so that it contains the appropriate 
values for your repository. This `README.md` can also be used as a template to design your own as GitHub will display 
it on your repository.

This template uses the mappings from [ParchmentMC](https://parchmentmc.org/docs/getting-started) but these can be changed to the official mojang mappings or 
yarn by following the appropriate steps [here](https://docs.architectury.dev/plugin/get_started).
